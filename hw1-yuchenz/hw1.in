P11800586A1090 Because the DPPD gene is not present in non-tuberculous bacilli, these results suggest that this molecule can be an additional tool for a more specific diagnosis of tuberculosis.

P11830544A0335 Herceptin, which recognizes the HER-2/neu antigen and has similar size (10 nm) to G6-(1B4M-Gd)(256), accumulated and internalized in the WIBC-9 tumors more quickly than in the control MC-5 tumors that progress with normal angiogenesis.
P11834476A1187 Therefore, in a large animal model of permanent focal ischemia in which transfusion starts 30 min after ischemia, tetrameric cross-linked hemoglobin transfusion can augment oxygen transport to the ischemic cortex, but the increase can be delayed and not necessarily provide protection.
P11836303A0518 TNFalpha and IL-6 levels were determined in the culture supernatants.
P11844812A0915 For the 2.5 to 4 ng/mL model, the AUC of the ANN ROC curve was significantly higher than the AUCs for percentage of free PSA (P =.0239), PSA-TZ (P =.0204), and PSA density and total prostate volume (P <.01 for both).
P11851941A0372 We therefore applied a radiolabelled serumalbumin method to determine blood volume after haemodilution with crosslinked or conjugated haemoglobin, in comparison with a reference solution of hydroxyethyl starch (HES).

P11872359A0000 It has been proposed that insulin resistance (IR) underlies a cluster of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors constituting a "metabolic syndrome." CVD is a leading cause of premature mortality among indigenous Australians.
P11879108A0719 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: A positive test result for gonococcal or chlamydial infection by the ligase chain reaction assay; secondary outcome measure was a positive test result for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
P11881923A1256 Neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, plasma haptoglobin, and CBG levels were greater (P < 0.01) during the INITIAL period than during the PRE or POST periods but did not differ between treatments.
P11886473A0796 Gastritis score was significantly lower in nod-/CagA- children than in nod+/CagA- (p =.004), nod-/CagA+ (p =.002) and nod+/CagA+ (p <.001), both in the antrum and corpus.
P11888867A0000 BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the postoperative serum level of TA90-IC, an immune complex of a 90-kDa tumor-associated antigen and its antibody, might have a significant correlation with recurrence and survival in patients with thick primary melanomas.
